**Example for Introduction：**

Background: Nowadays, there is a trend that ...

**Recently, a prevalent statement we often hear is that** increasing number of colleges intend to fund many social activities in order to attract those elite students. **A considerable number of opponents, however, propose** the idea that this policy is more likely to result in the far more exodus of top students from colleges **since** increasing needs of good students cannot be met in terms of this new financial policy. **As far as I am concerned, the former view seems to align more with my perspective, and two reasons would suffice here to support my point of view.**

Optional words: **It is partly deemed that** wealthy individuals are obliged to give their money to charities **because** great power comes to great responsibility. **Albeit seemingly plausible**, **I am convinced that** there should be no such moral standard in our society that the rich should make more donation than others.

**Example for Supporting Paragraph：**

1. 举例

   **Specifically**, unlike today, students without the help of the Internet, TV programs and published books to get access to the knowledge which they are interested in. **In this regard**, students are essential to follow their teachers all the time to gain the important things they need to know so that we often can see students and teachers were discussing paper and conducting experiment together. **By doing so**, their students would gain the chances to improve their academic level rapidly. 

2. 引用

   **Moreover**, psychological **studies indicates that** shopping is a perfect outlet for people to unleash the pent-up negative feelings. **In a word**, giving pocket change to children is a win-win strategy, It not only boosts children's self-seteem and happiness but also builds a healthy relationship and mutual trust between parents and children.

3. 对比

   **On the contrary**, teacher at the present time seem not to be as important as counterparts before. **This is because** the rise of the Internet and TV programs would afford students far more valuable and interesting information for students **so that** what teachers know may be far less than their students in one field. **Moreover**, far more TV programs and published books can provide them with sufficient amount of knowledge which guarantee them to teach by themselves successfully. 

4. 让步

   **True**, **although** teachers at the present time seem to maintain the greater amount of knowledge and diverse teaching methods to pass on far more valuable things for their students, **it is not to say that** teachers in the modern society is far more influential than counterparts in the past. **On the contrary**, teachers in the past seem to be more influential for students **because** they were the major channels for students to gain knowledge in the past time. 

**As a result**, the role of teachers in the current time is no longer as essential as counterparts in the past. **Thus**, teachers in the past exert a more important effect than those today.



**Example for Counterargument Paragraph:**

1. Counterargument

   **Though** study abroad **offers many advantages**, **some may argue that** a semester or year abroad is nothing but a vacation. 

2. Refute

   **Admittedly, it is true that** some students choose to treat studying abroad as a vacation rather than the rich academic experience that it can be. **However, we could find that those people wrong estimated the situation because**, the bad actions of a few students should not invalidate study abroad programs as whole or cause colleges to abandon their efforts in this regard. 

3. Support (Optional)

   **In fact**, in a long-term study of 3,400 students, Dwyer and Peters (2004)found that a large number said studying abroad had an impact on their world view (96 percent), increased their self-confidence (96 percent), and gave them the skill sets they needed for the career they chose (76 percent). Clearly, studying abroad is not just a party. Students’ home institutions should offer preparatory workshops and orientation seminars so that students will be ready for the requirements of the program and will better understand how it connects with their current academic work. 

4. Conclusion

   **Therefore**, Studying abroad unites academic demands with the thrill of discovering a new culture, and students will gain immeasurably more from the experience if they are prepared prior to departure for what they will discover there. 

   

**Example for Couclusion:**

**In conclusion, given the numerous benefits of** studying abroad, colleges and universities should require that their students take advantage of this opportunity. 

Study abroad programs enable students to explore life in a new culture which raises their cross-culture awareness. Students’ language competence also increases rapidly while learning in a foreign language environment. Besides, learning their own major in another country will allow students to learn new knowledge, approaches and perspectives. 

Thus, in an increasingly interconnected world in which one’s cross-culture competence is highly valued, studying a semester abroad will be the answer to prepare students for the future challenges. 

Optional: **Judging from all the evidence offered above, we can safely arrive at the conclusion that** wealthy people are never ought to be required more financial support to charity due to the reason that they are given the priority to take control of their money and contributions have already be made by them.
